 -------------------------------Exception-------------------------------------------------

 Exception :- Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event which occured at run-time that disturbs the normal
              flow of the execution. when Exception occurs program will terminate abnormally.

 Types :-
    1.Built-in Exception : The exceptions which are present in java library .
        a.checked Exception: Checked Exceptions are also called as compile-time Exception.Exceptions which are
                             checked at compile-time are called as compile-time Exception.
        b.Unchecked Exception: Unchecked Exceptions are the exceptions which are checked at run-time.
    2.Custom Exception(User-Defined Exception): Built-in Exceptions are not able to describe certain situation
      In such case, User can also create an exception which is User-defined Exception.

 Methods :
       1.printStackTrace() - Prints the exception information in the format of Name of the exception:description
         of the exception: stack trace
       2.toString() :- Print the exception as Name of the Exception:Description of the Exception
       3.getMessage() :- print only the description of the Exception.

 Exceptions:
            1.Checked Exception: IOException, FileNotFoundException,SQLException
            2.Unchecked Exception : NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException,StringIndexOutOfBoundException,NumberFormatException

 Exception Handling: Exception handling is a mechanism to handle the run-time errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.

 Exception Handlers:

 1. Try Block:
       1) Try block is used to enclose a code that might throw an exception.
       2) If an exception occurs at particular statement in try block the rest of the code will not execute.so it is recommended to not keep the code in try block that wil not throw an exception.
       3) Try block must be followed by either catch block or finally block.

 2. Catch Block:
       1) Java catch block is used to handle the exception by declaring the type of exception within the parameter.
       2) The declared Exception must be parent class exception(i.e.Exception) or generated Exception type
       3) Catch Block must be used after try block.
       4) There can be multiple catch blocks.

       * Multiple Catch Blocks:
       1. yes, we can use multiple catch blocks for single try block.
       2. Each catch block must contain different Exception Handlers.
       3. At a time, Only one Exception Occurs and at a time only one catch block executes.
       4. All catch blocks must be ordered from most specific to most general i.e. catch block for Arithmetic Exception comes before an Exception catch block.

 3. Nested Try Block:

    When we use try block inside another try block is called as Nested Try Block.

    * Why use Nested Try Block:
        sometimes a situation may arise that one part of block may cause one exception and entire block may cause another error at that time nested try block is used.

    When any try block does not have catch block for particular exception,then the catch block for a parent try block are checked for that exception.

 4. Finally Block :

    Finally block is always executed whether an exception occured in statement or not whether an occured exception is handled or not.
    used to put cleanup code such as closing the connection, closing the file

 5.  Throw :
            Throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.
            We specify the exception object which is to be thrown. The exception has message with it that provides error description.
            throw keyword is used to throw a checked or unchecked exception.
            It is mainly used to throw Custom Exception.
            If we throw an checked exception,it must to handle the exception using catch block or the method must declare it using throws keyword.

 6. Throws :
            throws keyword is used to declare an exception.
            It gives the information to the programmer that there may occur an exception.
            It is mainly used to handle Checked Exception.

 7.Custom or User-Defined Exception :
        1) custom exception is a derived from the Exception class.
        2) creating our own exception is known as ...
        3) here we have passed a string to the constructor of superclass.
